# Income Prediction
Hey! I'm Phillip, a current MS Data Science student at University of San Fracisco.    
     
This repo is a final project for my machine learning lab course (MSDS699) where I'll be fitting various machine learning models using practices learned in class and with the sklearn package.

# Data
This data was procured from the UCI Machine Learning Repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult where the data was extracted from a 1994 census database and will be used to attempt to predict a person's income of greater or less than $50,000.00 per year based on the extracted data.

# Conclusion 
After fitting various classification models, I was able to strengthen the prediction by a small amount with a RandomForestClassifier(). The increase to the F1 target metric was not much, so there's still more work to be done, but this was a good starting point.
